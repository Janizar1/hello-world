# hello-world
This is ascension of a long and decorative career in front end and back end development. 
I grew up using computers in the 80's. I've always been able to read different coding languages. MS-Dos being one of my favorite programs. I went to Heald College and learned software, hardware, and various program languages. I had networking and Cisco course also. I applied for positions in all areas, but recieved no feedback. After 6 months to a year of searching for a job in that field I took a sale/customer service position. Due to having a family I prioritized making money over the career choice i had chosen. I I however never stopped understanding the languages of computers. I have built my own websites for personal business, and for others. i will continue to build and create based on the knowledge I've recieved. Leon and 100Devs have reminde me of the work I've already ptu inand will continue to
